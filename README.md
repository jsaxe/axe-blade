### Tests & Linting

2. Make sure you write tests for all the changes/bug fixes.
3. Make sure all the tests are passing on `travis`.
4. Make sure to have full coverage on your tests.

### General Practices

ES6 shall be prefered for development, since it comes with latest javascript features. Also, we love comments. Be sure to comment your codes properly so that your fellow can understand you easily.

If commenting is not done properly, following may happen
>While Coding: Only You and God knows what it does

>After some time: Only God knows what it does

To prevent this, let's all commit to commenting. ðŸ˜‰
## Issues & Pull Requests

1. Always try creating regression tests when you find a bug (if possible).
2. Share some context on what you are trying to do, with enough code to reproduce the issue.
3. For general questions, please create a forum thread.
4. When creating a Pull Request for a feature, make sure to create a parallel Pull Request for docs too.
